vercI want to make sure that the system is setup to monitor and alert based on the entire project workflow below. Every single step needs to be tracked and alerted to the appropriate team members. I noticed you only had like 7 total steps it appears. It must be this below. 

Also, there must be an area on the settings or setup user interface where the admin can choose the team member that should be alerted based upon each and every step. The user interface setup section should be super simple to understand and use and look sharp and professional. Please make sure this functionality is part of the backend as well:
