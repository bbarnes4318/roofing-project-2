# PROJECT REQUIREMENTS PLAN (PRP)
## Roofing Project Management System - Complete Lifecycle Validation

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Project Name
Roofing Project Management System - Workflow Automation Validation

### Purpose
Validate the end-to-end project lifecycle automation within the roofing software, ensuring seamless workflow progression from lead generation to project completion without manual intervention.

### Scope
Complete validation of the automated workflow system including:
- Project creation via web form
- Automatic workflow initiation
- Sequential task generation and progression
- Phase transitions (Lead → Estimate → Contract → Execution → Completion)
- Project closure and archival

- **FR-007**: System shall automatically generate next sequential task upon current task completion
- **FR-008**: System shall maintain task sequence integrity per workflow definition
- **FR-009**: System shall assign tasks to appropriate users/roles automatically
- **FR-010**: System shall track task completion timestamps

### 2.3 Phase Transitions
- **FR-011**: System shall automatically transition project phases based on task completion
- **FR-012**: System shall update project status indicators during phase transitions
- **FR-013**: Phase progression sequence: Lead → Estimate → Contract → Execution → Completion

### 2.4 Project Completion
- **FR-014**: System shall recognize final task completion
- **FR-015**: System shall update project status to "Completed" or "Closed"
- **FR-016**: System shall prevent generation of new tasks after completion
- **FR-017**: System shall move completed projects to archived/read-only state

---

## 3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Performance
- **NFR-001**: Task generation shall occur within 2 seconds of previous task completion
- **NFR-002**: Phase transitions shall complete within 3 seconds
- **NFR-003**: System shall support concurrent project workflows

### 3.2 Reliability
- **NFR-004**: System shall maintain workflow state consistency during failures
- **NFR-005**: System shall log all workflow state changes for audit purposes

### 3.3 Usability
- **NFR-006**: Workflow progression shall be visible in real-time to users
- **NFR-007**: System shall provide clear status indicators for each phase

---

## 4. VALIDATION CRITERIA

### 4.1 Success Metrics
- 100% of tasks generate automatically in correct sequence

- [ ] CP-007: Task sequence follows predefined workflow
- [ ] CP-008: Phase transitions occur at correct points
- [ ] CP-009: All tasks maintain proper status tracking

### Phase 3: Project Completion
- [ ] CP-010: Final task marked as completed
- [ ] CP-011: Project status updated to "Completed/Closed"
- [ ] CP-012: No new tasks generated post-completion
- [ ] CP-013: Project moved to archived/read-only state

## 7. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 7.1 Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Workflow state corruption | Low | High | Implement transaction-based updates |
| Task generation failure | Medium | High | Add retry logic and error handling |
| Phase transition delays | Low | Medium | Optimize database queries |

### 7.2 Business Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete workflow execution | Low | High | Comprehensive validation testing |
| User confusion on status | Medium | Medium | Clear UI indicators and notifications |
