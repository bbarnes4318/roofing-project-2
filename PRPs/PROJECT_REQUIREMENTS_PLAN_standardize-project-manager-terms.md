# PROJECT REQUIREMENTS PLAN
## Standardize All Project Manager Terms

**Generated on:** 2025-08-07  
**Priority:** High  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Execute a comprehensive, case-insensitive replacement of "Product Manager" with "Project Manager" across the entire application stack, including codebase, database records, and all references to ensure consistent professional terminology throughout the roofing contractor management system.

---

## FEATURE REQUIREMENTS

### FR-001: Complete Terminology Standardization
- **Requirement:** Replace all instances of "Product Manager" with "Project Manager" 
- **Scope:** Full-stack (frontend, backend, database, documentation)
- **Case Sensitivity:** Case-insensitive search with case preservation
- **Atomicity:** Must be completed as a single, comprehensive update

### FR-002: Zero Tolerance Policy
- **Requirement:** After completion, zero instances of "Product Manager" must remain
- **Validation:** Automated verification required
- **Testing:** Application must build and run without errors post-change

---

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### TR-001: Codebase Analysis and Modification
- Search entire project directory for "Product Manager" (case-insensitive)
- Generate comprehensive file list for tracking
- Replace all instances preserving original casing patterns
- Update variable names, comments, UI text, and documentation

### TR-002: Database Schema and Data Updates
- Analyze PostgreSQL schema for potential "Product Manager" references
- Target tables: `roles`, `users`, `job_titles`, text fields, descriptions
- Execute SQL UPDATE statements to replace database records
- Verify database integrity post-update

### TR-003: Case Preservation Logic
- "Product Manager" → "Project Manager"
- "product manager" → "project manager" 
- "productManager" → "projectManager"
- "PRODUCT MANAGER" → "PROJECT MANAGER"

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis (30 minutes)
1. **Codebase Search**
   - Execute case-insensitive search across all file types
   - Generate comprehensive checklist of affected files
   - Categorize by file type (React components, API routes, database schemas)

2. **Database Analysis**
   - Query PostgreSQL schema for text columns
   - Search data records for "Product Manager" instances
   - Create list of affected table/column pairs

### Phase 2: Execution (60-90 minutes)
1. **Code Modifications**
   - Process each file on the checklist systematically
   - Apply case-preserving replacements
   - Validate syntax integrity after each change

2. **Database Updates**
   - Execute SQL UPDATE statements for each affected column
   - Use transactions to ensure atomicity
   - Backup verification before execution

### Phase 3: Verification and Testing (30-45 minutes)
1. **Zero Instance Verification**
   - Re-run codebase search (must return 0 results)
   - Re-run database queries (must return 0 results)
   - Document verification results

2. **System Validation**
   - Build frontend and backend
   - Run basic smoke tests
   - Verify no new errors introduced

## AFFECTED COMPONENTS

### Frontend (React)
- `/src/components/pages/` - UI text and labels
- `/src/components/common/` - Reusable components
- `/src/services/` - API service calls and documentation
- Configuration and constant files

### Backend (Express/Node.js)
- `/server/routes/` - API endpoint documentation
- `/server/services/` - Business logic comments
- `/server/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema comments
- Seed data and migration files

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- `User` table - role-related fields
- `Project` table - description fields
- Any enum values or lookup tables
- Historical data records

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk
- **Database corruption** if UPDATE statements are malformed
- **Application breakage** if variable names are inconsistently updated
- **Build failures** if imports/references become mismatched

### Medium Risk
- **UI inconsistencies** if some text replacements are missed
- **Search functionality** if hardcoded terms remain in filters

### Low Risk
- **Performance impact** during database updates
- **Minor syntax issues** in comments or documentation

---

## MITIGATION STRATEGIES

1. **Database Safety**
   - Create backup before any database modifications
   - Use transactions for all UPDATE operations
   - Test queries on development database first

2. **Code Integrity**
   - Process files systematically to avoid partial updates
   - Validate syntax after each file modification
   - Use version control to track all changes

3. **Testing Protocol**
   - Build verification after each major component update
   - Smoke test core application functionality
   - Verify real-time features (Socket.io) still function

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Primary Success Metrics
- ✅ Zero instances of "Product Manager" in codebase search
- ✅ Zero instances of "Product Manager" in database queries
- ✅ Application builds without errors
- ✅ Application runs without new runtime errors

### Secondary Success Metrics
- ✅ UI displays consistent "Project Manager" terminology
- ✅ API responses use correct terminology
- ✅ Database records reflect updated terms
- ✅ All tests pass (if test suite exists)

## EXECUTION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Execution
- [ ] Review current git status and commit any pending work
- [ ] Create backup of database (if possible)
- [ ] Verify development environment is stable

### Discovery Phase
- [ ] Execute comprehensive codebase search
- [ ] Document all affected files with line numbers
- [ ] Analyze database schema and data
- [ ] Create prioritized modification list

### Implementation Phase
- [ ] Process frontend component files
- [ ] Process backend service and route files
- [ ] Process configuration and schema files
- [ ] Execute database UPDATE statements
- [ ] Verify each change maintains application integrity

### Verification Phase
- [ ] Run final codebase search (expect 0 results)
- [ ] Run final database search (expect 0 results)
- [ ] Build frontend (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Build/start backend (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Execute smoke test of core functionality
- [ ] Document any issues or unexpected findings

### Post-Execution
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message
- [ ] Update relevant documentation
- [ ] Mark PRP as completed with timestamp

---

## ROLLBACK PLAN

If critical issues are discovered:
1. **Code Rollback:** Use git to revert to pre-change commit
2. **Database Rollback:** Restore from backup or run reverse UPDATE statements
3. **Verification:** Confirm system returns to original working state
4. **Analysis:** Document what went wrong for future attempts

**Plan Status:** Ready for Execution  
**Next Action:** Begin Phase 1 Discovery and Analysis  
**Estimated Completion:** 2-4 hours from start
