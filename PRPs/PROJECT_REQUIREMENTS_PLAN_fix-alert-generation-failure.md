# PROJECT REQUIREMENTS PLAN (PRP)
## Fix Alert Generation Failure

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Project Name**: Fix Alert Generation Failure

**Purpose**: Stabilize the application, restore core data flows, and repair dependent features for "Fix Alert Generation Failure".

**Scope**:
- Application stabilization (halt render/network loops)
- Core data pipeline restoration (projects, assignments)
- Dependent features repair (user assignment, roles)

---

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

The "My Alerts Page" is empty, indicating a complete failure of the alert generation and delivery pipeline. This is a major issue as it means users are not being notified of important project events.

---

## 3. SOLUTION PLAN

Detailed multi-phase repair plan is provided in the attached initial blueprint.

---

## 4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- The application is stable, core data loads correctly, and user-facing features function without errors.

---

## 5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- Performance: Page load stable and responsive (<2s typical)
- Reliability: No infinite loops or runaway requests after fix
- Observability: Logs and metrics available to confirm stability

---

## 6. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

- Risk: Regression during stabilization
  - Mitigation: Stage fixes, verify after each phase
- Risk: Data integrity issues
  - Mitigation: Validate API/store/render paths end-to-end
- Risk: Hidden coupling causes re-loop
  - Mitigation: Memoization, decoupled effects, equality guards

---

## 7. DELIVERABLES

- Stable application with loops eliminated
- Restored project data flows across API, state, and UI
- Functional user assignment and roles screens
- Validation notes and before/after evidence (HAR/logs)

---

## 8. EXECUTION NOTES

- Prioritize halting loops before functional repairs
- Instrument network and state transitions for visibility
- Validate each phase explicitly before proceeding

---

## 9. TIMELINE

- Phase 1 (Stabilize): 1-2 hours
- Phase 2 (Restore Core Data): 1-2 hours
- Phase 3 (Repair Dependents): 1 hour

## 10. ATTACHED INITIAL BLUEPRINT

## FEATURE:
Diagnose and repair the critical failure in the alerting system that is causing no alerts to be generated.

## PROBLEM CONTEXT:
The "My Alerts Page" is empty, indicating a complete failure of the alert generation and delivery pipeline. This is a major issue as it means users are not being notified of important project events.

## TASK - EXECUTION BLUEPRINT:

1.  **Backend Service Deep-Dive:**
    * **Action:** This is almost certainly a backend failure. Your primary focus must be on the alert services. Thoroughly investigate `server/services/AlertGenerationService.js` and `server/services/AlertSchedulerService.js`.
    * **Hypothesis:** Look for silent failures, incorrect logic that prevents alert conditions from being met, or a disabled scheduler. Check the server logs for any errors originating from these services.

2.  **Trigger Condition Analysis:**
    * **Action:** Review the logic that is supposed to trigger an alert (e.g., a task being completed, a message being received). Manually perform one of these actions in the application.
    * **Validation:** After performing the action, check the database directly to see if a new record was created in the `alerts` table. If not, the trigger logic is broken.

3.  **Implement and Verify the Fix:**
    * **Action:** Once you have identified the point of failure (e.g., a bug in the generation service, a broken trigger), implement the necessary code changes to fix it.
    * **Validation:** After deploying the fix, perform an action that should create an alert. Confirm that the new alert immediately appears on the "My Alerts Page."
