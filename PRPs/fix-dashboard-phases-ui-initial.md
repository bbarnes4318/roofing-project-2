## API Endpoints Required

### Existing Endpoints to Utilize
- `GET /api/projects` - Retrieve all projects with workflow data
- `GET /api/workflow/project/:projectId` - Get project workflow details
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId` - Get individual project data

### Potential New Endpoints
- `GET /api/projects/by-phase` - Projects grouped by workflow phase
- `GET /api/workflow/phases/summary` - Phase summary statistics

## Component Architecture

### New Components to Create
1. **DashboardPhasesSection.jsx**
   - Main container for phases display
   - Phase column layout and organization
   - Integration with project data

2. **PhaseColumn.jsx**
   - Individual phase column component
   - Phase header with count and styling
   - Project cards container

3. **PhaseProjectCard.jsx**
   - Specialized project card for phases view
   - Compact design with essential information
   - Phase-appropriate styling and actions

### Components to Modify
1. **DashboardPage.jsx**
   - Integrate phases section
   - Handle phase-based navigation
   - Manage state for phase interactions

## Styling Specifications

### Phase Color Scheme
```css
LEAD: Blue gradient (from-blue-500 to-blue-600)
PROSPECT: Teal gradient (from-teal-500 to-teal-600)  
APPROVED: Purple gradient (from-purple-500 to-purple-600)
EXECUTION: Orange gradient (from-orange-500 to-orange-600)
SUPPLEMENT: Pink gradient (from-pink-500 to-pink-600)
