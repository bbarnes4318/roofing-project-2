## FEATURE:
Execute a definitive, root-cause analysis and repair for the catastrophic failure of the "My Projects" page, which currently results in a blank white screen. All previous attempts have failed. This is the final and complete plan to restore core functionality.

## PROBLEM CONTEXT:
The "My Projects" page is the heart of the application, and it is completely non-functional. Clicking the navigation link leads to a blank page, indicating a critical failure in the component rendering lifecycle, the data-fetching pipeline, or both. This is the highest priority bug in the system.

## TASK - THREE-PHASE DIAGNOSTIC & REPAIR BLUEPRINT:
You are to execute the following three phases in this precise order. You are to assume nothing works and must validate every step. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is 100% successful.

### --- PHASE 1: STABILIZE THE RENDER (GET SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN) ---

Your first and only priority is to stop the blank screen failure. The page must render *something*, even if it's an error message.

1.  **Isolate the Page Component:**
    * **Action:** The first step is to achieve a minimal render. Go to the main routing file (`src/App.jsx` or similar). Find the route for the "My Projects" page. **Temporarily replace the entire `<MyProjectsPage />` component with a simple `<h1>It Renders!</h1>` element.**
    * **Validation:** Deploy this change. When you navigate to the "My Projects" page, you **must** see the text "It Renders!". If you still see a blank screen, the problem is in the routing or application shell itself, and you must fix that first.

2.  **Diagnose the Component Crash:**
    * **Action:** Now that you've proven the route works, restore the `<MyProjectsPage />` component. Immediately wrap the **entire return statement** of the `MyProjectsPage.jsx` component in a React Error Boundary.
    * **Task:** The error boundary must be designed to catch any rendering error and display a fallback UI with a detailed error message.
    * **Validation:** Navigate to the page again. It should no longer be blank. It should now display your error boundary's fallback UI, which will contain the specific JavaScript error that is causing the component to crash. Document this error.

3.  **Fix the Rendering Error:**
    * **Action:** Based on the error message you captured, implement a direct fix. If the component is crashing because data is `null` or `undefined` during the initial render, you must add defensive code (e.g., `if (!data) { return <LoadingSpinner />; }`) at the top of the component to handle the loading state gracefully.
    * **Validation:** The "My Projects" page must now load successfully and display its basic structure (like a title or a loading indicator) without crashing or showing an error message.

### --- PHASE 2: REPAIR THE DATA PIPELINE ---

With the component now stable and rendering, you must diagnose and fix the data flow.

1.  **Test the API Endpoint Directly:**
    * **Action:** Use a command-line tool like `curl` to make a direct request to the backend API endpoint that serves the project list (e.g., `curl http://localhost:5000/api/projects`).
    * **Validation:** Confirm that the API returns a valid JSON response containing the project data. If it fails, the problem is on the backend, and you must fix the API before continuing.

2.  **Diagnose Frontend Data Fetching:**
    * **Action:** Investigate the data-fetching logic inside `MyProjectsPage.jsx`. Add `console.log()` statements to trace the entire lifecycle:
        1.  Log a message right before the `fetch` call is made.
        2.  Log the raw response from the API.
        3.  Log any errors caught in your `.catch()` block.
        4.  Log the data right before it is passed into the state management store.
    * **Validation:** You must pinpoint the exact location where the data flow is failing and implement a fix.

### --- PHASE 3: FINAL VALIDATION ---

1.  **End-to-End Test:**
    * **Action:** Clear all caches and perform a full end-to-end test. Navigate to the "My Projects" page from the main dashboard.
    * **Success Criterion:** The page must load quickly, without errors, and correctly display the complete and accurate list of projects from the database. All buttons and interactive elements on the page must be functional.
