# PROJECT REQUIREMENTS PLAN (PRP)
## INITIAL

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Project Name**: INITIAL

**Purpose**: Stabilize the application, restore core data flows, and repair dependent features for "INITIAL".

**Scope**:
- Application stabilization (halt render/network loops)
- Core data pipeline restoration (projects, assignments)
- Dependent features repair (user assignment, roles)

---

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Problem context is provided in the attached initial blueprint.

---

## 3. SOLUTION PLAN

Detailed multi-phase repair plan is provided in the attached initial blueprint.

---

## 4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- The application is stable, core data loads correctly, and user-facing features function without errors.

---

## 5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- Performance: Page load stable and responsive (<2s typical)
- Reliability: No infinite loops or runaway requests after fix
- Observability: Logs and metrics available to confirm stability

---

## 6. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

- Risk: Regression during stabilization
  - Mitigation: Stage fixes, verify after each phase
- Risk: Data integrity issues
  - Mitigation: Validate API/store/render paths end-to-end
- Risk: Hidden coupling causes re-loop
  - Mitigation: Memoization, decoupled effects, equality guards

---

## 7. DELIVERABLES

- Stable application with loops eliminated
- Restored project data flows across API, state, and UI
- Functional user assignment and roles screens
- Validation notes and before/after evidence (HAR/logs)

---

## 8. EXECUTION NOTES

- Prioritize halting loops before functional repairs
- Instrument network and state transitions for visibility
- Validate each phase explicitly before proceeding

---

## 9. TIMELINE

- Phase 1 (Stabilize): 1-2 hours
- Phase 2 (Restore Core Data): 1-2 hours
- Phase 3 (Repair Dependents): 1 hour

## üìã Recommendations


### URGENT: Fix Critical Path Failures
5 critical elements are not functioning. These must be fixed immediately to restore core functionality.


### HIGH: Address Form Submission Issues
2 form elements are failing. Review form validation and API endpoints.



## Summary

‚ö†Ô∏è **5 elements require attention.** Priority should be given to 5 high/critical issues.

‚úÖ No infinite loops detected - recent fixes are stable.
