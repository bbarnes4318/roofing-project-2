## 🔍 Incident Analysis

### Critical Evidence from HAR File Analysis

**Network Request Patterns:**
- **Total Entries**: 696 network requests in 47 seconds
- **Page Loads**: 151 page refreshes (3.22 per second)
- **API Request Loops**:
  - `/api/projects`: 81 requests (1.79 requests/second) 
  - `/api/alerts`: 40 requests (0.85 requests/second)
- **Response Codes**: All API requests returned 500 Internal Server Error

**Timeline Analysis:**
```
19:43:57.602Z - Loop begins
19:43:58.755Z - Second page load cascade
19:44:00.139Z - Continuous page refreshing
19:44:44.531Z - Loop ends (47 second duration)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: Infinite state update cascade in `DashboardPage.jsx`

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix):
useEffect(() => {
  if (dashboardState) {
    // This triggers state updates that cause dashboardState to change
    setExpandedPhases(new Set(dashboardState.expandedPhases));
    setSelectedPhase(dashboardState.selectedPhase);
  }
}, [dashboardState]); // Dependency on dashboardState creates infinite loop
```

**Loop Cycle:**
1. `dashboardState` prop changes
2. useEffect fires, updates local state
3. Parent component detects state changes, updates `dashboardState` prop
4. Cycle repeats infinitely
5. Each cycle triggers page refreshes and API calls

## 🛠️ Resolution Implementation

### Structural Fix Applied

**Solution**: State reference tracking to prevent cascade loops

```javascript
// FIXED CODE (after resolution):
// Track processed dashboard states to prevent infinite loops
const processedDashboardStateRef = useRef(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (dashboardState && dashboardState !== processedDashboardStateRef.current) {
    processedDashboardStateRef.current = dashboardState;
    
    // Safe to update state - will only happen once per unique dashboardState
    if (dashboardState.expandedPhases) {
      setExpandedPhases(new Set(dashboardState.expandedPhases));
    }
    if (dashboardState.selectedPhase) {
      setSelectedPhase(dashboardState.selectedPhase);
    }
  }
}, [dashboardState]); // Safe dependency with reference tracking
```

**Additional Fixes:**
- Added `processedRefetchStateRef` for refetch logic
- Prevented duplicate dashboard state processing
- Maintained all existing functionality while eliminating loops

### Files Modified
- **Primary**: `src/components/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`
- **Lines Changed**: 158-171, 379-423
- **Technique**: Reference tracking with useRef to prevent duplicate processing

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### Implemented Safeguards

1. **Code Review Guidelines**
   - Mandatory review for useEffect dependency arrays
   - State management pattern validation
   - Performance impact assessment

2. **Automated Monitoring**
   - Request pattern anomaly detection
   - Performance regression alerts
   - Memory usage monitoring

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Infinite loop detection in CI/CD
   - Production validation automation
   - Performance benchmarking

### Development Best Practices

```javascript
// GOOD PRACTICES for preventing similar issues:

// 1. Always use reference tracking for complex state dependencies
const processedRef = useRef(null);
useEffect(() => {
  if (state && state !== processedRef.current) {
    processedRef.current = state;
    // Safe to process state changes
  }
}, [state]);

// 2. Memoize selectors to prevent new references
const memoizedData = useMemo(() => {
  return expensiveComputation(rawData);
}, [rawData]);

// 3. Use stable function references
const stableCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // function implementation
}, []); // Empty dependencies if truly stable
```
