# Project Profile Page Redesign Documentation

## Overview
The Project Profile Page has been completely redesigned to provide a modern, professional, and visually appealing user experience while maintaining all existing functionality. The redesign focuses on improved visual hierarchy, better user interaction, and enhanced readability.

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
- **Clear Information Architecture**: Information is organized in logical sections with clear visual separation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information is hidden by default and revealed on demand
- **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform padding and margins create a clean, organized layout

### 2. Modern UI/UX Patterns
- **Card-Based Layout**: Information is grouped into distinct cards for better organization
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Subtle gradients add visual depth without being distracting
- **Icon Integration**: Meaningful icons enhance visual communication and improve scanability
- **Hover States**: Interactive elements provide clear feedback on user actions

### 3. Color and Typography
- **Brand Consistency**: Uses the existing brand colors (blue #0066CC, red accents)
- **Accessible Contrast**: Ensures sufficient contrast ratios for readability
- **Typography Scale**: Consistent font sizes and weights for better hierarchy

## Key Visual Improvements
