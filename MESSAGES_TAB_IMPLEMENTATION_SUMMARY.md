# Messages Tab Add Message Implementation Summary

## Problem
The 'Add Message' feature in the 'Messages' tab of the project profile section was directing to a blank page instead of providing the same functionality as the dashboard dropdown.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing State Variables
Added the following state variables to `ProjectMessagesPage.jsx` to match dashboard functionality:
- `newMessageRecipients` - Array for multiple recipient selection
- `attachTask` - Boolean for task attachment toggle
- `taskAssignee` - String for task assignee selection

### 2. Updated Form Structure
Replaced the old form structure with the exact layout from the dashboard:
- **First Row**: Subject and To fields (with multiple recipient selection)
- **Second Row**: Task assignment checkbox and dropdown
- **Message Textarea**: Reduced to 2 rows for consistency
- **Action Buttons**: Cancel and Send Message with proper validation

### 3. Enhanced Recipient Selection
- Changed from single user selection to multiple recipient selection
- Added predefined user options matching dashboard
- Added "All Users" option
- Included helper text for multiple selection

### 4. Improved Task Assignment
- Added checkbox for "Send as a Task" option
- Conditional dropdown for task assignee selection
- Proper state management for task attachment

### 5. Updated Styling
- Matched dashboard button styling exactly
- Consistent spacing and padding
- Proper color mode support
- Responsive grid layout

### 6. Form Validation
- Updated validation logic to check for recipients array
- Proper disabled state for submit button
- Form reset functionality

## Key Features Now Available

✅ **Multiple Recipient Selection**: Users can select multiple recipients using Ctrl/Cmd+click
✅ **Task Attachment**: Optional task creation with assignee selection
✅ **Consistent UI**: Exact visual match with dashboard dropdown
