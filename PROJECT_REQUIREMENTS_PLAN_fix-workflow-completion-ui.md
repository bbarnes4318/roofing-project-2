# Project Requirements Plan: Fix Workflow Completion UI

## 1. FEATURE SPECIFICATION

**Feature Name**: Workflow Completion UI Visual Feedback System
**Priority**: Critical
**Type**: Bug Fix / Core Functionality Enhancement

**Description**: Overhaul the workflow completion UI to fix critical visual state update bugs where users cannot see proper feedback when completing tasks. Implement a comprehensive three-tiered visual feedback system for line item, section, and phase completion with persistent state management.

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Current Issue
The project workflow section is fundamentally broken with the following critical problems:
- UI fails to provide clear visual feedback when users complete tasks
- Checkbox state changes are not visually persistent
- No hierarchical completion indicators for sections and phases
- Users are confused about whether their completion actions were successful
- Visual state does not persist after page refresh

### Impact
- **Critical**: Core application functionality is compromised
- **User Experience**: Users cannot effectively track their progress
- **Business Process**: Project workflow management is unreliable
- **Data Integrity**: Unclear if completion states are properly saved

### Root Cause
Missing or broken visual feedback system for task completion at all hierarchical levels

## 3. SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Line Item Completion Visual Feedback**
- When user clicks a checkbox, system SHALL display persistent checkmark icon (✅)
- Completed line item text SHALL have strikethrough decoration (`line-through`)
- Visual state MUST persist after page refresh
- Checkbox state SHALL accurately reflect backend completion status

**FR-2: Section Completion Hierarchical Logic**
- System SHALL automatically check completion status of all line items within a section
- When ALL line items in a section are complete, section name SHALL display strikethrough
- Section strikethrough SHALL be removed when any line item becomes incomplete
- Section completion state SHALL update dynamically in real-time

**FR-3: Phase Completion Hierarchical Logic**
- System SHALL automatically check completion status of all sections within a phase
- When ALL sections in a phase are complete, phase name SHALL display strikethrough
- Phase strikethrough SHALL be removed when any section becomes incomplete
- Phase completion state SHALL update dynamically in real-time

**FR-4: State Persistence**
- All completion states MUST persist across page refreshes
- Backend synchronization SHALL maintain data integrity
- Visual state SHALL accurately reflect database state on load

### 3.2 Technical Requirements

**TR-1: Component Architecture**
- Primary implementation in `src/components/workflow/WorkflowView.jsx` or equivalent
- Hierarchical completion logic SHALL be modular and reusable
- Visual feedback components SHALL be responsive and accessible

**TR-2: State Management Integration**
- Integration with existing state management system (Redux/Zustand/useState)
- Real-time state updates without page refresh required
- Consistent state synchronization between UI and backend

**TR-3: Performance Requirements**
- Completion status calculations SHALL execute within 100ms
- UI updates SHALL be immediate and smooth
- Minimal re-rendering impact on other components

## 4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Analysis and Discovery
1. Locate primary workflow component (`WorkflowView.jsx` or similar)
2. Identify existing state management patterns
3. Map current completion tracking implementation
4. Analyze backend API integration for completion states

### Phase 2: Line Item Completion Implementation
1. Implement persistent checkbox visual feedback
2. Add strikethrough decoration for completed line items
3. Ensure state persistence across page refreshes
4. Test individual line item completion functionality

### Phase 3: Section Completion Logic
1. Implement section-level completion detection algorithm
2. Add dynamic strikethrough for completed sections
3. Create logic to remove section strikethrough when incomplete
4. Test section completion hierarchy functionality

### Phase 4: Phase Completion Logic
1. Implement phase-level completion detection algorithm
2. Add dynamic strikethrough for completed phases
3. Create logic to remove phase strikethrough when incomplete
4. Test phase completion hierarchy functionality

### Phase 5: Integration and Validation
1. Integrate all completion levels into unified system
2. Validate state persistence and synchronization
3. Perform comprehensive testing across scenarios
4. Optimize performance and user experience

## 6. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Visual Feedback Requirements
```css
/* Line Item Completion */
.completed-line-item {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}

.checkbox-completed {
  display: ✅; /* or equivalent checkmark icon */
}

/* Section Completion */
.completed-section-title {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}

/* Phase Completion */
.completed-phase-title {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

### State Structure Requirements
```javascript
{
  phases: [
    {
      id: 'phase-id',
      name: 'Phase Name',
      completed: boolean,
      sections: [
        {
          id: 'section-id',
          name: 'Section Name',
          completed: boolean,
          lineItems: [
            {
              id: 'item-id',
              name: 'Line Item Name',
              completed: boolean
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Completion Logic Algorithm
1. **Line Item Update**: Update individual item completion status
2. **Section Check**: Calculate if all line items in section are complete
3. **Section Update**: Update section completion status based on line items
4. **Phase Check**: Calculate if all sections in phase are complete
5. **Phase Update**: Update phase completion status based on sections
6. **UI Refresh**: Update visual feedback for all affected elements

## 7. TESTING STRATEGY

- Section completion calculation accuracy
- Phase completion calculation accuracy
- State persistence mechanisms

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end completion workflow
- Backend synchronization validation
- Cross-component state consistency

- **Test Scenario 3**: Complete all sections in phase and verify phase strikethrough
- **Test Scenario 4**: Uncheck completed items and verify strikethrough removal
- **Test Scenario 5**: Page refresh persistence validation
