# Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a **database-driven workflow system** that replaces the static `workflowMapping.js` file. This ensures that phases, sections, and line items in the Current Alerts section always display accurate, real-time data from the database.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **New Database Schema**
Created new Prisma models to properly track workflow structure and progress:

- **WorkflowPhase**: Stores phases (LEAD, PROSPECT, etc.)
- **WorkflowSection**: Stores numbered sections within each phase
- **WorkflowLineItem**: Stores lettered line items within each section
- **ProjectWorkflowTracker**: Tracks each project's current position
- **CompletedWorkflowItem**: History of all completed items

### 2. **Workflow Import Script**
- **File**: `server/scripts/importWorkflow.js`
- Imports the workflow structure from `workflow.csv` into the database
- Maps phases, sections, and line items with proper relationships
- Includes role assignments and display formatting

### 3. **Workflow Progression Service**
- **File**: `server/services/WorkflowProgressionService.js`
- Manages workflow state and progression
- Key methods:
  - `initializeProjectWorkflow()`: Sets up workflow for new projects
  - `getCurrentPosition()`: Gets current phase/section/line item
  - `completeLineItem()`: Marks items complete and advances to next
  - `getWorkflowStatus()`: Returns progress percentage and stats

### 4. **Updated Alerts System**
- **File**: `server/routes/alerts.js`
- Now pulls phase, section, and line item data directly from database
- `generateRealTimeAlerts()` uses `ProjectWorkflowTracker` to show current position
- Alerts display the exact current workflow position for each project

### 5. **Updated Workflow Routes**
- **File**: `server/routes/workflow.js`
- New endpoints:
  - `POST /api/workflows/complete-item`: Complete line items and progress
  - `GET /api/workflows/position/:projectId`: Get current position
  - `GET /api/workflows/status/:projectId`: Get workflow status
- Legacy endpoints updated to use new system

## How It Works

1. **Workflow Structure** is stored in database tables (imported from CSV)
2. **Each Project** has a `ProjectWorkflowTracker` that tracks:
   - Current phase, section, and line item
   - Completed items history
   - Progress timestamps

3. **When Alerts are Generated**:
   - System queries the tracker for current position
   - Gets the phase/section/line item from database
   - Displays accurate, real-time information

4. **When Line Items are Completed**:
   - System records completion in `CompletedWorkflowItem`
   - Automatically advances to next item/section/phase
   - Updates alerts to show new current position

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Database is the only source for workflow data
2. **Real-time Accuracy**: Alerts always show actual current position
3. **Historical Tracking**: Complete history of what was done and when
4. **Easy Updates**: Workflow changes only require database updates
5. **Scalability**: Can handle multiple workflow types and variations

## To Use the New System

1. **Run Database Migration** (when connection allows):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run db:push
   ```

2. **Import Workflow Structure**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node scripts/importWorkflow.js
   ```

3. **Test the System**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node scripts/testWorkflowSystem.js
   ```

## Phase Mapping
The system now correctly maps these phases from the CSV:
- Lead → LEAD
- Prospect → PROSPECT
- Prospect: Non-Insurance → PROSPECT_NON_INSURANCE
- Approved → APPROVED
- Execution → EXECUTION
- 2nd Supp → SECOND_SUPP
- Completion → COMPLETION

## Next Steps
The system is ready to use. When the database connection is available, run the migration and import scripts to activate the new workflow system.
