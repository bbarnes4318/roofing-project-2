## FEATURE:
Diagnose and repair the critical failure in the alerting system that is causing no alerts to be generated.

## PROBLEM CONTEXT:
The "My Alerts Page" is empty, indicating a complete failure of the alert generation and delivery pipeline. This is a major issue as it means users are not being notified of important project events.

## TASK - EXECUTION BLUEPRINT:

1.  **Backend Service Deep-Dive:**
    * **Action:** This is almost certainly a backend failure. Your primary focus must be on the alert services. Thoroughly investigate `server/services/AlertGenerationService.js` and `server/services/AlertSchedulerService.js`.
    * **Hypothesis:** Look for silent failures, incorrect logic that prevents alert conditions from being met, or a disabled scheduler. Check the server logs for any errors originating from these services.

2.  **Trigger Condition Analysis:**
    * **Action:** Review the logic that is supposed to trigger an alert (e.g., a task being completed, a message being received). Manually perform one of these actions in the application.
    * **Validation:** After performing the action, check the database directly to see if a new record was created in the `alerts` table. If not, the trigger logic is broken.

3.  **Implement and Verify the Fix:**
    * **Action:** Once you have identified the point of failure (e.g., a bug in the generation service, a broken trigger), implement the necessary code changes to fix it.
    * **Validation:** After deploying the fix, perform an action that should create an alert. Confirm that the new alert immediately appears on the "My Alerts Page."
